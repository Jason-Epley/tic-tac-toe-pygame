# tic-tac-toe-pygame
Tic-Tac-Toe in Python/Pygame 🎮

Overview

  This is a customized version of Tic-Tac-Toe built in Python with Pygame. Unlike a standard tutorial version, this project includes:
  
  A graphical interface with custom design elements
  
  Player vs Player and Player vs AI modes
  
  Three AI difficulty levels (Easy = random, Medium = smart/random blend, Hard = optimized Minimax with alpha-beta pruning)
  
  Two board sizes: Classic 3x3 and Connect 4-style 4x4
  
  Undo move system (Ctrl+Z or button) with move history tracking
  
  Smooth piece placement animations with visual effects
  
  Game timer and move counter display
  
  Five quick-apply color themes plus full RGB customization
  
  Scoreboard and replay system
  
  Sound effects with adjustable volume controls
  
  Player name and symbol customization (10 shape options)
  
  The game is designed as part of my NCLab Python Capstone Project and demonstrates problem solving, design decisions, and original enhancements beyond the basics.

Development Roadmap for Tic-Tac-Toe (Pygame)
Phase 1 – Setup & Core Game

  ✅ Install Python 3.9+ and Pygame.
  
  ✅ Create GitHub repo + set up main.py (skeleton we wrote).
  
  ✅ Draw board lines using Pygame.
  
  ✅ Allow players to place X and O on clicks.
  
  ✅ Alternate turns (done in skeleton).
  
  Add win detection logic (check rows, columns, diagonals).
  
  Display game over message (temporary text in console or on screen).

Phase 2 – Polish Base Game

  Reset board when a game ends (new round without restarting).
  
  Add a scoreboard to track wins, losses, draws.
  
  Create a simple menu screen:
  
  Choose Player vs Player or Player vs AI.
  
  Choose player names/symbols.

Phase 3 – AI Opponent

  ✅ Implement Easy AI (random move).
  
  ✅ Implement Medium AI (60% smart, 40% random for balanced challenge).
  
  ✅ Implement Hard AI (Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and depth limiting).
  
  ✅ Add option in menu to pick Easy/Medium/Hard AI.

Phase 4 – User Experience Enhancements

  ✅ Add colors/graphics customization (10 shape options, 5 themes, full RGB control).
  
  ✅ Highlight the winning line when someone wins with pulsing animation.
  
  ✅ Add sound effects (move, AI move, win, lose, draw, menu sounds) with volume controls.
  
  ✅ Smooth animations (scale-up piece placement, visual effects).
  
  ✅ Add undo move system (Ctrl+Z and button).
  
  ✅ Add game timer and move counter display.

Phase 5 – Final Touches

  Add replay button (instead of restart).
  
  Update README.md with screenshots and instructions.
  
  Record presentation demo.
  
  Push final version to GitHub with tags/releases.

Build & Packaging
------------------

If you want to distribute the game to other users (Windows EXE), PyInstaller is the simplest option. The repository includes a spec file `TicTacToe_Python_Capstone_Project_1.spec` that bundles the `assets/` folder so sounds and other resources are available at runtime.

Recommended steps (Windows PowerShell):

1. Install PyInstaller:

```powershell
pip install pyinstaller
```

2. Build a one-folder distribution (recommended for apps with many assets):

```powershell
# From the repo root
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onedir --add-data "assets;assets" TicTacToe_Python_Capstone_Project_1.py
```

This creates `dist\TicTacToe_Python_Capstone_Project_1\` containing the executable and an `assets/` directory. Users can run the EXE directly from that folder.

3. Or build using the provided spec file (it already includes the assets tree):

```powershell
pyinstaller TicTacToe_Python_Capstone_Project_1.spec
```

Notes & tips
- The app includes a `resource_path()` helper so asset lookup works when running from source, `--onedir` builds, or `--onefile` bundles (PyInstaller extracts files to a temp folder). If you change asset layout, update `resource_path` usage accordingly.
- For best portability, ship `bgm.ogg` (OGG is broadly supported). MP3 support depends on SDL_mixer build on some platforms.
- Single-file builds (`--onefile`) are possible but will extract assets to a temp folder at runtime and can increase startup time. Use `--onedir` for simpler distribution.
- To produce an installer (optional), package the `dist\TicTacToe_Python_Capstone_Project_1` folder with an installer builder (Inno Setup, NSIS) or zip it for users.

If you'd like, I can add a small `build.ps1` script that runs the pyinstaller command and packages the output into a zip for distribution.

## Verification

After building, verify the distribution on a clean machine or VM to ensure assets (sounds) and music codecs load correctly.

Minimal manual test checklist:

- Unzip or copy the contents of the build folder (from `dist/`) to the test machine.
- Run the executable inside the folder (Windows: the .exe in the folder). The game should open a window.
- Go to Settings and confirm:
  - The RGB sliders are visible and draggable.
  - "Sound Effects Volume" and "Music Volume" sliders are present and audible (if your machine has audio output).
  - If music doesn't start, the top-right of Settings will show a small notice indicating bgm is missing or unavailable.
- Start a game and ensure move sounds and win/draw/lose sounds play when appropriate.

If you prefer an automated helper, run the included PowerShell helper from the repo root to build & ZIP the output:

  .\build.ps1

This will build using the spec (if present) or run a one-folder build and create a timestamped zip file you can transfer to a test VM.

Headless CI / running tests in CI
--------------------------------

When running automated tests or importing the module in headless CI runners, Pygame may fail to create a display/renderer. To run Pygame in headless mode set the SDL_VIDEODRIVER environment variable to "dummy" before importing or running Pygame code. Example (GitHub Actions):

```yaml
- name: Run tests (headless)
  env:
    SDL_VIDEODRIVER: dummy
  run: |
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    python -m pytest -q
```

This tells SDL to use a dummy video driver so Pygame won't attempt to open an actual window. Use this in CI steps that only need to import the game or run unit tests that don't require a visible UI.
